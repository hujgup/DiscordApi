When a Discord event fires, it fires a series of events on other objects. This document describes the order in which those events should fire.

1. Object instance (if it exists)
2. Containers (e.g. Server instance for server channels)
3. Static object (e.g. ChannelCategory for a category)
4. Interface assist object (e.g. ChannelUtils for a channel)
